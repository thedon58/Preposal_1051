# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Growing up playing Super Mario Bros on the original Nintendo, I would love to take the Mario code and make it more of my own. Whether that will be changing the layout of the game, characters, or purpose of it is still up in the air, but this is definitely an idea that I would like to work with. Another idea would be to create a fake sports gambling platform with real-time data that will update the odds during a game, match, race, etc.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I just want to know how much will actually be expected of us for this project. At first glance it seems like it could be a lot to handle for someone like me who has only been programming since the beginning of the semester, so I hope what I propose and eventually do will be enough.
